                The goal of Trend Health is not to make recommendations of which
                sectors or stocks to buy based on their score. The application
                specifically allows the user to modify the Fast and Slow MA
                periods and technical indicator weightings, in order to reduce
                Trend Health’s subjectivity to a minimum.

                Rather, the goal of Trend Health is to be a place where Trend

                in the stock market are made over longer term holding periods. A
                Trend Follower with the knowledge that their portfolio holdings
                maintain positive scores is less likely to sell early in a bull
